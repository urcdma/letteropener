The boss wants to develop a GUI tool that utilizes OpenAI's GPT model API to perform several tasks.
The tool should allow users to upload .py files, describe the code's purpose and functionality for beginners, 
evaluate the code's main functions and structure, list all technical knowledge points related to the code's function and structure, 
and create Feynman-style memory cards explaining each core knowledge point based on the information returned from the previous steps.
The front of the card should be in Chinese, and the back should be in English. 
The tool should also have a download button for users to download the generated .apkg file. The user requirement is: As a Python beginner, 
I want to learn Python basics through Anki flashcards so that I can easily remember them.
